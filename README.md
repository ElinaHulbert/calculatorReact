##### :muscle: What was my motivation?
This project is my second React App and I had an opportunity to practice my skills in hooks.
##### :books: What did I learn?
How to use useState, working with arrays and JSX. Also, added a clear button to the calc. 
##### :flashlight: How to use the project?
By clicking on the link below if you prefer to use a fancy calc :)

(Deployed as a React App with Heroku. It might take time to load)
Or by opening the code in you fav editor and using "npm start"
